# Java-Projects

Currently consists of 5 projects with notes that detail the programming and Java specific concepts.
Very basic and perfect when one wants to get down to the simple things to take a break from the complexities of coding.

Notes are in Markdown. Working more and slowly increasing the difficulty level can easily land any entry level Java project job. 
But always gotta dream big!
