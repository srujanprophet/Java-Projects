# HashMap

As you already know, there are different ways to create a map filled with key-values pairs. Today it's time to take a good look at the `HashMap`: an effective instrument that is probably the most popular implementation of the `Map` interface. It provides very fast access to its elements and falls within the top ten questions at Java job interviews.

## 1. How does it work?

The `HashMap` class represents a map backed by a **hash table**. To understand what it is let's start with the internal organization of `HashMap`.

If you look inside `HashMap` you will see that it's an array with **buckets** as its elements. The default size of such an array is 16.

What could be a "bucket" in a programming language? Actually, each bucket is a linked list, meaning there are 16 linked lists for storing key-value pairs. And each key-value pair is an element of a linked list.

Now we need a special structure to store the key-value pairs as well. This structure is a class called `Node`. It has four fields: the first one is hash, then there's our key and value, and the last one contains a link to the next pair.

Now you know how `HashMap` looks inside and ready to learn what is happening when you put an element in it. Any ideas on how a `HashMap` decides where to put your key-value pair?

Here's what happens: first, it generates the hash code of your key. Next, it generates the index of the bucket which depends on the calculated hash.
In this formula below `n` is a number of buckets:
```
index = hash & (n - 1)
```

Now that `HashMap` has decided which linked list will store your pair, it will check if this linked list is empty. If it is, your pair will be the start-element of that linked list. Otherwise, your pair will become a new tail.

Thanks to the hash function, this implementation provides **constant-time** performance for `get` and `put` methods! Constant-time means O(1) complexity.

Now that you've mastered the theory of the `HashMap` organization, it's time to consider some examples.

## 2. Time to play!

![dasdas](https://ucarecdn.com/b4a25cb4-b927-433a-acd4-0e21f5e22115/)
```java
Map<Integer, String> characters = new HashMap<>();

characters.put(1000, "Cinderella");
```

Here we've created a `HashMap` called `characters` and added `"Cinderella"` in it. There are exactly 16 buckets. The class has calculated that the index of the new bucket would be 8.

In the picture, you can see that `"Cinderella"` is the first `Node` of the 8th linked list. As we've said earlier, `Node` has four fields.

In our example, the hash code and the key are the same. For `Integer` class hash code is the same as its value.

> Note that every class has different logic for calculating hash code. You can override the method `hashCode` as well.

Also, it's good to know that it is possible to create a pair in which the key would be `null`. The hash code of the null-key is always zero.

Now let's add more characters and see what will happen:

![dasd](https://ucarecdn.com/9326c834-859a-4f32-b579-3db8e1ad36fa/)

```java
characters.put(2000, "Prince");
characters.put(3000, "Evil stepmother");

// {2000=Prince, 1000=Cinderella, 3000=Evil stepmother}
System.out.println(characters); 
```

Character `"Prince"` decided to be in the bucket with index 0. He is also the first `Node` in his linked list.

But a stepmother can't be far away from poor Cinderella! `"Evil stepmother"` is also staying in the bucket with the number 8.

As you can see, the field `next` in Cinderella's `Node` has changed. Now the field has a link to the next character, `"Evil stepmother"`.

Because the `"Evil stepmother"` became the last one in this linked list, her field `next` has value `null`.

Let's try to remove an element from `HashMap` `characters`:

![das](https://ucarecdn.com/2c5f3f47-419e-415b-9f59-e10599978489/)
```java
characters.remove(3000); // get rid of Evil stepmother

System.out.println(characters.get(3000)); // null
```

An element `"Evil stepmother"` was deleted. `"Cinderella"` became the first and the last element of the eighth linked list again.

> To see the structure of your `HashMap`, as in the pictures, you can use Debug mode in IntelliJ IDEA.

There are a lot of different methods in the class `HashMap`. We will only look at some of them.

Getting an element by a key:
```java
System.out.println(characters.get(1000)); // Cinderella
```
Method `putIfAbsent`:
```java
characters.putIfAbsent(2000,"Another Prince"); // nothing happens, because there is already a Prince

System.out.println(characters.get(2000)); // Prince
```

Check, if there are a concrete key or a value inside of `HashMap`:
```java
System.out.println(characters.containsKey(1000)); // true
System.out.println(characters.containsValue("Fairy Godmother")); // false
```

## 3. For the interview

Let's consider some interesting moments. Firstly, you, as a software engineer, can choose what number of buckets will be in `HashMap`. Remember, that the default initial capacity must be a power of two:
```java
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>(32);
```

Another important point is collisions. There is always a chance of a situation when two distinct keys will generate the same hash code. This situation is called a **collision**.
```java
map.put("AaAaAa","First");
map.put("BBBBBB","Second");
```

If the two keys have the same hash code but the keys are different, the second element will be put right after the first one.

In this example keys `"AaAaAa"` and `"BBBBBB"` have the same hash code, and `Node` with the value `"First"` will have a link to the `Node` with the value `"Second"`.

![dasd](https://ucarecdn.com/480c76ba-ce82-4934-b840-a6bb75a6e02d/)

Method `equals` is used for checking if the two keys are different. If they are the same the second pair will replace the first one.

If there are a lot of collisions in a `HashMap` the complexity for `get` and `put` methods becomes **O(n)**.

Because of that, class `HashMap` was upgraded. Since Java 8, it provides the *collision resolution mechanism*. If linked lists are too long then `HashMap` changes their structure: all linked lists become balanced trees. The new complexity is **O(log(n))**.

Finally, it's important to note that `HashMap` can change the number of buckets. If there are too many pairs in your buckets `HashMap` will change its size to a bigger one. It will transfer all your previous elements to the new version of itself. That, unfortunately, will take some time. And the more elements there are the longer transferring will take.

## 4. When to use it?

The short answer to the question in the title is if you need to store key-value pairs and want the mutable implementation of the `Map` interface. `HashMap` class is often used in practice since it is highly optimized for accessing elements. Also, iteration over `HashMap` is highly effective.

And what about the disadvantages? Well, nobody's perfect. There is no way to avoid collisions. The size of `HashMap` may increase so that it will take some time to transfer all the elements.

At last, remember, that `HashMap` class makes no guarantees as to the order of the map. It also does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.
