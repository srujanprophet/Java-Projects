# Anonymous classes

Sometimes developers need to use a small class that overrides some methods of another class or interface only **once**. In this case, declaring a new class may be superfluous. Fortunately, Java provides a mechanism for creating a class in a single statement without having to declare a new named class. Such classes are called **anonymous** because they don't have name identifiers like `String` or `MyClass` (but they do have an internal name).

## 1. What is an anonymous class?

Anonymous classes enable you to declare and instantiate a class at the same time.

An anonymous class always implements an interface or extends another class (concrete or abstract). Here is the common syntax of creating an anonymous class:

```java
new SuperClassOrInterfaceName() {

    // fields

    // overridden methods
};
```

The syntax of an anonymous class is an expression. And it's similar to a constructor call except that there is a class definition contained in a block of code.

> An anonymous class must override all abstract methods of the superclass. That is, all interface methods must be overridden except default methods. If an anonymous class extends a class that has no abstract methods, it doesn't have to override anything.

## 2. Writing anonymous classes

Let's assume we have the following interface with two methods:
```java
interface SpeakingEntity {

    void sayHello();

    void sayBye();
}
```

Here is an anonymous class that represents an English-speaking person:
```java
SpeakingEntity englishSpeakingPerson = new SpeakingEntity() {
            
    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello!");
    }

    @Override
    public void sayBye() {
        System.out.println("Bye!");
    }
};
```

The anonymous class is declared and instantiated at the same time â€” as an expression. It overrides both methods of the interface.

We assign an instance of the **anonymous class** to the variable of the interface type. Now, we can invoke overridden methods:

```java
englishSpeakingPerson.sayHello();
englishSpeakingPerson.sayBye();
```

Of course, the result is
```
Hello!
Bye!
```

Let's declare and instantiate another anonymous class:
```java
SpeakingEntity cat = new SpeakingEntity() {

    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }

    @Override
    public void sayBye() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
};
```

When we invoke the same methods, we obtain the following result:

```
Meow!
Meow!
```

So, `englishSpeakingPerson` and `cat` are instances of different anonymous classes that implement the same interface.

## 3. Accessing context variables

In the body of an anonymous class, it is possible to capture variables from a context where it is defined:

- an anonymous class can capture members of its enclosing class (the outer class);
- an anonymous class can capture local variables that are declared as `final` or are **effectively final** (i.e. the variable is not changed but it doesn't have the `final` keyword).

Here is another anonymous class that implements the `SpeakingEntity` interface:

```java
public class AnonymousClassExample {

    private static String BYE_STRING = "Auf Wiedersehen!"; // static constant

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        final String hello = "Guten Tag!"; // final local variable

        SpeakingEntity germanSpeakingPerson = new SpeakingEntity() {

            @Override
            public void sayHello() {
                System.out.println(hello); // it captures the local variable
            }

            @Override
            public void sayBye() {
                System.out.println(BYE_STRING); // it captures the constant field
            }
        };

        germanSpeakingPerson.sayHello();

        germanSpeakingPerson.sayBye();
    }
}
```

The anonymous class captures the constant field `BYE_STRING` and the local final variable `hello`. This code is successfully compiled and prints what we expect:
```
Guten Tag!
Auf Wiedersehen!
```

> A declaration of a variable or a method in an anonymous class shadows any other declaration in the enclosing scope that has the same name. You cannot access any shadowed declarations by their names.

## 4. When to use anonymous classes

Generally, you should consider using an anonymous class when:

- only one instance of the class is needed
- the class has a very short body
- the class is used right after it's defined

In this topic, we've considered rather simple anonymous classes to understand the basic syntax, but in real-life applications, they provide a powerful mechanism for creating classes that encapsulate behaviors and pass them to suitable methods. This is a convenient way to interact with parts of our application or with some third-party libraries.
