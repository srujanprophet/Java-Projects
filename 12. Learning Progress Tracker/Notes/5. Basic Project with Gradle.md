# Basic project with Gradle

## 1. The key concepts of Gradle

Let's start with an introduction to the key concepts in Gradle: **projects** and **tasks**.

- A **project** might represent either **something to be built** (e.g. a JAR file or ZIP archive) or **a thing to do** (e.g. deploying the application). Every Gradle build contains one or more projects.
- A **task** is a single piece of work that a build performs. This can include compiling classes, running tests, generating docs, and so on. Every project is essentially a collection of one or several tasks.

The following picture illustrates the relationships between these concepts:

In simple cases, a build will contain only a single project with several tasks. This will be a common situation in your learning process.

## 2. Initializing a basic project managed by Gradle

Let's initialize a new project with Gradle using a terminal in your OS.

> In the future, you most likely will not have to do this manually since modern IDEs can do this for you automatically.

1. Create a new directory to store files of your project and go to it.
```
mkdir gradle-demo
cd gradle-demo
```
2. Invoke the `gradle init` command to generate a simple project. Modern versions of Gradle will ask you to fill several parameters in a dialogue form. To get acquainted with the process just choose `basic` as the type of project and `Groovy` as the build script DSL.

This command will produce the following output:
```
> Task :init

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 10s
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
```

Gradle performed some tasks for you and now there is a simple project with the most basic structure:
```
.
├── build.gradle
├── gradle
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
└── settings.gradle
```

Here is brief info about all the generated files:

- The `build.gradle` file is a primary file that specifies the Gradle's project, including its tasks and external libraries. For now, this file doesn't contain anything useful, but in real projects it is often updated with new information.
- The files `gradle-wrapper.jar`, `gradle-wrapper.properties`, `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` belong to Gradle Wrapper which allows you to run Gradle without its manual installation.
- The `settings.gradle` file specifies which projects to include in your build. This file is optional for a build that has only one project, but it is mandatory for a multi-project build.

Let's build our project invoking the `gradle build` command from the same location where `build.gradle` resides. It will produce an output like this:
```
> Task :buildEnvironment

------------------------------------------------------------
Root project
------------------------------------------------------------

...

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 725ms
1 actionable task: 1 executed
```

So, the project was successfully built with one executed task.

> You can also invoke `build` and other commands like `./gradlew build` for Unix-based systems and `gradlew.bat` build for Windows. It will automatically download Gradle and run the specified command. Using wrappers allows developers to start working with a Gradle-based project without having to install it manually.

## 3. Modifying the build file

Let's make our build more interesting by adding some properties and one task to the `build.gradle` file using Groovy DSL.
```
description = "A basic Gradle project"

task helloGradle {
    doLast {
        println 'Hello, Gradle!'
    }
}
```
Here, we set the `description` property and define a simple task that prints a 'hello' message. There is an output after executing the task with the `gradle -q helloGradle` command:

```
> Task :buildEnvironment

------------------------------------------------------------
Root project - A basic Gradle project
------------------------------------------------------------

...

> Task :helloGradle
Hello, Gradle!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 831ms
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
```

This build was completed with 2 tasks executed. Our new task printed the `Hello, Gradle!` message. In addition, we modified the description of the project in the build. The `-q` argument just simplifies the command output.

> You can also use Kotlin as DSL inside the build file. To allow it, you need to specify Kotlin as DSL when creating a project. In this case, the name of the file will be `build.gradle.kts`.

## 4. The list of all the tasks

If you would like to see all the possible Gradle tasks to perform, just run the `gradle tasks --all` command. The list will include our tasks as well:
```
> Task :tasks

------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks runnable from root project - A basic Gradle project
------------------------------------------------------------

Build Setup tasks
-----------------
init - Initializes a new Gradle build.
wrapper - Generates Gradle wrapper files.

Help tasks
----------
buildEnvironment - Displays all buildscript dependencies declared in root project 'gradle-demo'.
...

Other tasks
-----------
helloGradle
```

In a real project, the list of tasks will be much larger, because, in addition to standard tasks, it will contain a lot of tasks from various plugins (like Java or Kotlin plugin).

We've considered all Gradle-related files from the generated simple project in isolation from any source code files.

## 5. Conclusion

You've learned the key concepts of Gradle projects and studied all the files from a simple generated project in isolation from any source code files.
