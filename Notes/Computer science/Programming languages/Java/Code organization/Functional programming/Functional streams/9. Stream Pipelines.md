# Stream pipelines

By this topic, you have already learned different types of stream operations such as `filter`, `map` and `reduce`. Now is the time to start using these operations together and get into more details on the real stream pipelines. In a sense, the idea of this topic is to consolidate your knowledge about streams and to guide you through more complex practice exercises.

## 1. More about operations in stream pipelines

As a rule, production-ready streams contain multiple operations at once. It is possible to distinguish the following kinds of operations:

- filtering: using `filter` or other methods to skip some of the elements like `skip`, `limit`, `takeWhile` and so on;
- mapping or modifying stream elements: for example, sorting or removing duplicates;
- reducing or combining: `reduce`, `max`, `min`, `collect`, `count` , `findAny`, and so on.

This is not a coincidence. These groups of operations compose a standard data pipeline in many information systems and streams are well suited to simulate them.

Let's consider an example of a stream with several operations. Suppose, there is a list of strings named `words`. We would like to count the total number of words that start with `"JA"` . The case is not important: `"ja"`, `"jA"`, and `"Ja"` are suitable as well.

Here is our solution with the `map`, `filter` and `count` operations.

```java
List<String> words = List.of("JAR", "Java", "Kotlin", "JDK", "jakarta");

long numberOfWords = words.stream()
        .map(String::toUpperCase)         // convert all words to upper case
        .filter(s -> s.startsWith("JA"))  // filter words using a prefix
        .count();                         // count the suitable words

System.out.println(numberOfWords); // 3
```
Here is a picture that explains how this stream works:

> If you use **IntelliJ IDEA** as your primary IDE and would like to visualize stream pipelines, you can [read this article](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/analyze-java-stream-operations.html) and install [the Java Stream Debugger plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9696-java-stream-debugger).

It is obvious, that the result is 3 because the list contains only three suitable words (`"JAR"`, `"Java"`, `"jakarta"`).

## 2. The order of execution

But there is also one less obvious thing in the case of the previous example: the order of operations in this stream. It seems that the `filter` operation is only called after the `map` operation has converted all the elements to the upper case. But that is not always true. We can see it by ourselves by adding the `peek` operation to print the intermediate elements of the stream.

> [As Javadoc says](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#peek-java.util.function.Consumer-), the `peek` method exists mainly to support debugging, where you want to see the elements as they flow past a certain point in a pipeline. Do not forget to remove it after debugging is completed.

After adding the `peek` operation before and after `filter`, the stream will look like this:
```java
long numberOfWords = words.stream()
        .map(String::toUpperCase)
        .peek(System.out::println)
        .filter(s -> s.startsWith("JA"))
        .peek(System.out::println)
        .count();
```
And here is its output:
```
JAR
JAR
JAVA
JAVA
KOTLIN
JDK
JAKARTA
JAKARTA
```
This output actually means, that the `filter` operation is applied to an element right after the element was mapped.

> Do not try to predict the order of operations in a complex stream. Depending on the operations, the actual execution order may slightly differ from the expected one because of the internal stream optimization. The main point is that a stream will produce the result regardless of the execution order.

## 3. Streams with custom classes

In real situations, streams often process custom classes designed specifically for the program.

Let's assume that we have the `Event` class that represents a public event, such as a conference, a film premiere, or a concert. It has two fields:

- `beginning` (`LocalDate`) is a date when the event happens;
- `name` (`String`) that is the name of the event (for instance, `"JavaOne â€“ 2017"`).

Also, the class has getters and setters for each field with the corresponding names.

We also have a list of instances named `events`.

Let's find all names of events that will occur from **December 30** to **December 31, 2017** (inclusively).
```java
LocalDate after = LocalDate.of(2017, 12, 29);
LocalDate before = LocalDate.of(2018, 1, 1);
        
List<String> suitableEvents = events.stream()
        .filter(e -> e.getBeginning().isAfter(after) && e.getBeginning().isBefore(before))
        .map(Event::getName)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

The code above finds names of all suitable events and collects them to a new list of strings. The map methods allow us to make the transition from `Event` objects to the `String` objects.

## 4. Mapping and reducing functions

Since functions are presented as objects of certain classes, we can `map` and `reduce` them similar to regular stream elements.

For example, we have a collection of integer predicates. Let's negate each predicate by using a map operator and then conjunct all predicates into one by using a reduce operator.

```java
public static IntPredicate negateEachAndConjunctAll(Collection<IntPredicate> predicates) {
    return predicates.stream()
            .map(IntPredicate::negate)
            .reduce(n -> true, IntPredicate::and);
}
```

In this example, `map` negates each predicate in a stream and then `reduce` conjuncts all predicates into one. The **initial value** (seed) of reducing is a predicate that is always `true`, because it's the neutral value for conjunction.

So, the input predicates `P1(x), P2(x), ..., Pn(x)` will be reduced into one predicate `Q(x) = not P1(x) and not P2(x) and ... and not Pn(x)`. Of course, this is not the most frequent way to apply streams, but it's worth knowing that such use is also possible.

## 5. Conclusion

As you have seen, stream pipelines allow writing short and readable code to perform various evaluations. It is possible to combine many different operations in a single powerful stream. Keep in mind, that the order of performing the operation is determined by the stream itself. Do not try to influence it in any way.
