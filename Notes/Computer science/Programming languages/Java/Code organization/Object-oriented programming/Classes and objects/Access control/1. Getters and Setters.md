# Getters and setters
## 1. Data encapsulation
* According to the **data encapsulation** principle, the fields of a class are hidden from being directly accessed from other classes. The fields can be accessed only through the methods of that particular class.
* To access hidden fields programmers write special types of methods: **getters** and **setters**. Getters can only read fields, setters can only write (modify) the fields. Both types of methods should be `public`.
* Using these methods gives us some advantages:
	* the fields of a class can be made read-only, write-only or both;
	* a class can have total control over what values are stored in the fields;
	* users of a class don’t know how the class stores its data and don’t depend on the fields.

## 2. Getters and setters
* Java doesn’t provide any special keywords for getter and setter methods. Their main difference from the other methods is their names.
* According to the  [JavaBeans Convention](https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/jnut/ch06_02.htm) :
	* **getters** start with **get**, followed by the variable name, with the first letter of the variable name capitalized;
	* **setters** start with **set**, followed by the variable name, with the first letter of the variable name capitalized.
This convention applies to any types except `boolean`. A **getter** for a boolean field start with **is**, followed by the variable name.
* **Example 1.** The class `Account` has four fields: `id`, `code`, `balance` and `enabled`. Each field has a keyword **private** to hide the field from direct access from other classes. Also, the class has public getters and setters for accessing fields through these methods.
```java
class Account {
    private long id;
    private String code;
    private long balance;
    private boolean enabled;
    public long getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public void setId(long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public String getCode() {
        return code;
    }
    public void setCode(String code) {
        this.code = code;
    }
    public long getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
    public void setBalance(long balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }
    public boolean isEnabled() {
        return enabled;
    }
    public void setEnabled(boolean enabled) {
        this.enabled = enabled;
    }
}
```

* Sometimes, **getters** or **setters** can contain a more sophisticated logic. For example, **getters** may return non-stored values (calculated at runtime), or **setters** may also in some cases modify the value of another field according to changes. But usually, getters and setters have a minimum of programming logic.
* **Example 2.** In the following class, the setter `setName` doesn’t change the current value if the passed value is `null`.
```java
class Patient {
    private String name;
    public Patient(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }   
    public void setName(String name) {
        if (name != null) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    }
}
```

## 3. Conclusion
* To restrict access to fields from external code , we make them `private` and write suitable **getters/setters** to **read/change** only the fields we need.
