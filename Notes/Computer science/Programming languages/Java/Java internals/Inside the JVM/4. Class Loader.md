# Class Loader

A typical enterprise Java application may comprise thousands of source and dependency classes. To handle all of them in a proper way JVM introduces a special mechanism called **class loader**. It is a part of **JRE** responsible for dynamic loading classes into memory. Understanding class loading allows to control this process and helps to avoid some types of exceptions.

First of all, let's recall that java code goes through 2 stages: a compilation from source code to byte code (`.java -> .class`) and a byte code interpretation. The task of a class loader is finding the needed class through `.class` files from a disc and loading a representing object into the RAM. However, classes are not loaded in bulk mode on the application startup. A class loader loads them on-demand during an interpretation starting with a class containing the main method. The on-demand approach means that the class will be loaded on its first invocation. It can be a constructor call, e.g. new `MyObject()` or a static reference to a class, e.g. `System.out`

## 1. Internals

A **class loader** concept is represented by `java.lang.ClassLoader` abstract class. There are 3 standard `ClassLoader` implementations:

- **Bootstrap** loads JDK internal classes e.g. `java.util` package.

- **Extension/Platform** loads classes from JDK extensions.

- **Application/System loads** classes from application **classpath**.

One may ask what comes first if classes are loaded by a class loader and the `ClassLoader` itself is a class. To answer the question let's consider a sequence of these `ClassLoaders` invocations. First, JRE creates the **Bootstrap** `ClassLoader` which loads core classes. Then, **Extension** `ClassLoader` is created with **Bootstrap** as a parent. It loads classes for extensions if such exist. Finally, the **Application** `ClassLoader` is created with **Extension** as a parent. It is responsible for loading application classes from a classpath. Each class loaded in memory is identified by a fully-qualified class name and `ClassLoader` that loaded this class. Moreover, `Class` has a method `getClassLoader` that returns the class loader which loads the given class.

Take a look at the example:
```java
import java.sql.SQLData;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClassLoader listClassLoader = ArrayList.class.getClassLoader();
        ClassLoader sqlClassLoader = SQLData.class.getClassLoader();
        ClassLoader mainClassLoader = Main.class.getClassLoader();

        System.out.println(listClassLoader); // null
        System.out.println(sqlClassLoader.getName()); // platform
        System.out.println(mainClassLoader.getName()); // app
    }
}
```

## 2. Delegation model

When the class loader receives a request for loading a class, it follows certain steps in order to resolve the class. Default behavior defined by JVM specification:

1. Check if the class has already been loaded

2. If not, delegate the request to a parent

3. If the parent class returns nothing, it attempts to find the class in its own classpath

Default logic can be overridden in custom class loaders. So web container class loaders will look for classes in the local **classpath** and only in case the class is not found will delegate resolving to a parent.

## 3. Example

Let's consider an application that consists of 2 classes. Although it does nothing, it is a good example of a class loader explanation.
```java
public class A {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B b = new B();
    }
}
```
```java
public class B {
}
```
Launch the program by command:
```
java A
```
Let's go through key points of class loading during code execution:

1. Bootstrap `ClassLoader` is invoked by JRE on the start `java` process. It loads `java` internal packages.

2. Extension `ClassLoader` is invoked but loads nothing.

3. Application `ClassLoader` is invoked and loads class `A`.

4. When the constructor of class `B` is invoked `ClassLoader` of class `A` (Application `ClassLoader`) is invoked to load class `B` and delegates loading to Extension `ClassLoader`.

5. Extension `ClassLoader` is invoked and delegates loading to Bootstrap `ClassLoader`.

6. Bootstrap `ClassLoader` is invoked and tries to resolve the class, but finds nothing and returns control to Extension `ClassLoader`.

7. Extension `ClassLoader` finds nothing as well and returns control to Application `ClassLoader`.

8. Application `ClassLoader` resolves the class and loads it into memory.

## 4. When something goes wrong

Let's have a quick glance at problems related to class loaders. The common root cause comes because runtime dependencies may differ from compile-time ones. For instance, a project may be compiled successfully, but some classes were not added to the classpath. In that case, a class loader cannot find a class. That leads to `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoClassDefFoundError`. Another kind of exception happens because a project was compiled with one version of a class, but the classpath includes a different one. In that case `NoSuchMethodError` or `NoSuchFieldError` are thrown.

## 5. Conclusion

A class loader is a part of JRE that loads byte code classes from a file system into RAM. It is a dynamic on-demand concept. There are 3 standard class loaders: bootstrap, platform, and system. A class loading process is performed according to a delegation model. Although dealing with classloading is not a daily job for most programmers, understanding the concept helps to investigate some types of exceptions. It is highly required for building complex systems like web frameworks as well.
