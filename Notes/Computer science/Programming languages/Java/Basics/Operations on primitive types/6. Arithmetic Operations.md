# Arithmetic Operations
## 1. Binary arithmetic operators
* The Java programming language provides operators to perform arithmetic operations:
	* addition `+`
	* subtraction `-`
	* multiplication `*`
	* integer division `/`
	* remainder `%`
	
* The operators are called binary because they take two values as operands.
* The following example prints results of **addition**, **subtraction**, and **multiplication**.
```java
System.out.println(13 + 25); // prints 38
System.out.println(20 + 70); // prints 90
 
System.out.println(70 - 30); // prints 40
System.out.println(30 - 70); // prints -40
 
System.out.println(21 * 3);  // prints 63
System.out.println(20 * 10); // prints 200 
```

* The `/` operator returns the integer part of the division of 2 integer numbers, any fractional part is discarded.
```java
System.out.println(8 / 3); // prints 2
System.out.println(41 / 5); // prints 8 
```
* The `%` in Java is the modulus or remainder operator. It returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. Note, that when the dividend is less than the divisor, the quotient is zero and the remainder equals the dividend.
```java
System.out.println(10 % 3) // prints 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1
System.out.println(12 % 4) // prints 0, because 12 divided by 4 leaves no remainder
System.out.println(5 % 9) // prints 5, because 5 divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 5 
```

## Writing complex expressions

* The operations can be combined to write more complex expressions:
```java
System.out.println(1 + 3 * 4 - 2); // prints 11 
```
* The calculation order coincides with arithmetic rules. Multiplication has a higher priority level than addition and subtraction, so the operation `3 * 4` is calculated first.
* To specify the order of execution we can use `parentheses` as in the following:
```java
System.out.println((1 + 3) * (4 - 2)); // prints 8 
```
* As in arithmetic, `parentheses` can be nested. We can also use them for clarity.

## Unary operators
* A unary operator takes a single value as the operand.
	* The **unary plus** operator indicates a positive value. Itâ€™s an optional operator.
```java
System.out.println(+5); // prints 5
```
	* The **unary minus** operator negates a value or an expression.
```java
System.out.println(-8);  // prints -8
System.out.println(-(100 + 4)); // prints -104 
```

* They both have a higher level of precedence than the **multiplication** and **division** operators.

## The precedence order
There is a  [precedence order](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11precedence/)  of all arithmetic operators, including parentheses. The list below is sorted from the highest to the lowest precedence level.
	* parentheses
	* unary plus/minus
	* multiplication, division
	* addition, subtraction
