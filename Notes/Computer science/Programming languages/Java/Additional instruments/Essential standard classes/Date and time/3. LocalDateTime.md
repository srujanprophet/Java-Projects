# LocalDateTime

The class `LocalDateTime` is a combination of `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` that keeps such values as `2017-12-03T22:30`. It still doesn't store information on a time-zone. It could be used to store a date and time of a transaction in a payment system. As in the `LocalTime` class, time is represented to nanosecond precision.

## 1. Creating LocalDateTime and current time

An instance of `LocalDateTime` that represents **this** current moment can be obtained as below:
```java
LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now(); // this moment
```
The class has static methods `of` and `parse` to create instances:
```java
LocalDateTime dt1 = LocalDateTime.of(2017, 11, 25, 22, 30);  // 25 November 2017, 22:30
LocalDateTime dt2 = LocalDateTime.parse("2017-11-25T22:30"); // 25 November 2017, 22:30
```

It's also possible to obtain an instance from the instances of `LocalDate` and `LocalTime`, like this:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2017, 11, 25); // 2017-11-25
LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(21, 30); // 21:30
        
LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(date, time); // 2017-11-25T21:30
```

or by using special instance methods of `LocalDate` and `LocalTime`:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2017, 11, 25); // 2017-11-25
LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(21, 30); // 21:30       

LocalDateTime dateTime1 = date.atTime(time); // 2017-11-25T21:30
LocalDateTime dateTime2 = time.atDate(date); // 2017-11-25T21:30
```

## 2. LocalDateTime: from years to minutes

Now let's observe some methods of the `LocalDateTime` class. We've already created an instance `dateTime` to represent the 25 of November, 2017, 10:30 pm :
```java
LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2017, 11, 25, 22, 30); // 25 November 2017, 22:30
```

The class `LocalDateTime` has methods for obtaining units of date and time, such as a month, day of the month, hour and minute:
```java
int month = dateTime.getMonthValue(); // 11
int day = dateTime.getDayOfMonth(); // 25
int hour = dateTime.getHour(); // 22
int minute = dateTime.getMinute(); // 30
```

The class also has instance methods `toLocalDate` and `toLocalTime` to get the date and time as the whole parts of `LocalDateTime`:
```java
LocalDate dateOf = dateTime.toLocalDate(); // 2017-11-25
LocalTime timeOf = dateTime.toLocalTime(); // 22:30
```

## 3. Arithmetic methods of LocalDateTime

The class has methods to add, subtract and alter years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds as well as `LocalDate` and `LocalTime`. Let's explore them with a different example:
```java
LocalDateTime endOf2017 = LocalDateTime.of(2017, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59); // 2017-12-31T23:59:59
```

This is how by adding one second we get into another year or move by years:
```java
LocalDateTime beginningOf2018 = endOf2017.plusSeconds(1); // 2018-01-01T00:00
LocalDateTime beginningOf2020 = beginningOf2018.plusYears(2); // 2020-01-01T00:00
```
We can also alter the constituents of the `LocalDateTime` by indicating its values:
```java
LocalDateTime beginningOf2020 = beginningOf2018.withYear(2020); // 2020-01-01T00:00
```

As you see, `LocalDateTime` is another **immutable** class from the `java.time package`. It represents a combination of `LocalDate` and `LocalTime`.
