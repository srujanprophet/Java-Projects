# Relational Data Model

## 1. Introduction

The **Relational Data Model** (RDM) is an abstract mathematical model on the basis of which modern databases are designed. Here's the list of several relational DBMS: Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, etc. Knowing about RDM will help you better understand the concept of building modern databases and competently design information systems. Let's explore the main components of RDM.

## 2. Important terms

Let's start with some definitions. The RDM is based on the concept of relation. A **relation** is essentially a two-dimensional table that represents some entity or relationship.

An **entity** is an abstraction of some object (like a class in OOP), for example, a student, a car, a building. **A relationship** defines how entities are interconnected. For example, each student studies in one of the groups, such a relationship in Relational DB is called **many-to-one** relationship (more on the types of relationships below).

A relation consists of attributes and tuples. An **attribute** is a column in a table, some property of which has a relation. For example, in relation to a student, there are the following attributes: last name, first name, date of birth, and student number. A **tuple** is a row in a table, a collection of specific attribute values.

For example, for a student relation with the attributes student number, last name, first name, date of birth, the tuple can be `88881111`, `Jackson`, `John`, `01.01.2000`. A relation with its attributes can be briefly denoted as follows: `Student`(`student number`, `last name`, `first name`, `date of birth`).


| student | number | 	last name | 	first name | 	date of birth |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 88881111 |	Jackson | 	John |	01.01.2000 |

## 3. Restrictions

The following restrictions are imposed on the relations in the relational data model:

1. There cannot be two relations with the same name in a database.
2. All attributes within the same relationship have to have different names.
3. There should only be one value in each cell.
4. The order of the rows and columns in the relations is not important.

## 4. Entity Integrity

**Integrity** is the conformity of a data model with certain rules. There are two kinds of integrity: **entity integrity** and **referential integrity**.

The integrity of the entity means that there cannot be two *identical* tuples (rows) in the table. As in the real world, we cannot have two absolutely identical objects, for example, there are no identical students, they are all distinct. To maintain the integrity of an entity, the concept of a **primary key** (PK) is introduced.

For example, let's take a relation between the two tables, `Student` and `Group`:

What if we want to add the following record about a student: `88881188`, `Madison`, `Peter`, `01.02.2002`, `132`? It will cause a referential integrity violation because we have no group where the `group number` equals `132`.

## 5. Referential Integrity

**Referential integrity** occurs when we have two connected relations. The relationship of the relations is provided using a **foreign key (FK)**. A foreign key is an attribute of a relation (subordinate/dependent) that points to the primary key of another relation (main/master). Referential integrity means that there cannot be a foreign key in the main table that points to a nonexistent tuple in the subordinate table.

For example, there are two relations: student and group. The Group has an attribute number, which is the primary key, and the Student relation has the same attribute, which indicates the student's belonging to a certain group. In student relation, the group number is a foreign key. If in the Student table for some tuple the value of the foreign key points to the tuple of a group that is not in the Group table, then there will be a violation of the referential integrity.

| Student |student number 	|last name |	first name| 	date of birth 	|group number|
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --------- |
|88881111 |	Jackson |	John |	01.01.2000 |	123|
|88881122 |	Peterson |	James 	|05.06.2001 |	123|
|88881177 |	Depp 	|John |	15.03.1995 	|199|

`Student`

|Group |group number |	date of receipt|
| ----- | --------- | ---------------- |
|123 |	12.04.2019|
|199 |	11.07.2020|

`Group`

FK is used to create a many-to-one (one-to-many) relationship.

## 6. Relationships

There are relationships of one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many types.

- **one-to-one relationship (1-1)** means that one tuple of the first relation can be associated with no more than one tuple of another relation. The opposite is also true. For example, passport — citizen (one person can have only one passport and a passport refers to one person).
- **one-to-many relationship (1-M)** means that a tuple of the first relation can be associated with one or more tuples of the second relation, but the opposite is *not true*. Any tuple of the second relation can be associated with *only one* tuple of the first relation. For example, student — group (there can be many students in a group, but each student belongs to only one group).
- **many-to-many (M-M) relationship** means that any tuple of the first relation can be associated with one or more tuples of another relation. The opposite is also true. For example, student — discipline (each student studies many disciplines, each discipline can be studied by many students).

> It should also be noted that many-to-many relationships do **not exist** in RDM. It is split into two one-to-many relationships, so that an intermediate *associative* relation appears, which has two foreign keys as attributes that indicate the primary keys of the original relations.

Any of the relationships described above can be identifying or non-identifying. A relationship is **identifying** if the foreign key of a subordinate relationship goes into (or becomes part of) its primary key. For example, the order number (PK of order relation) in the store is generated based on the customer number and the order date. The customer number is the PK for the customer relation. The order number is a composite PK of two attributes: customer number (also a foreign key) and order date.

In a **non-identifying** relationship the foreign key relationship does NOT go to the primary key, for example, the Student-Group relationship discussed above.

## 7. Pros and cons

One of the main reasons why RDM is so popular is that there is a query language SQL, with which you can easily interact with data. Another reason is that it is based on a mathematical apparatus based on set theory. For large data volume, DBMS implementations based on other (usually simpler and less general) data models can be more scalable and performant than relational DBMS. One other disadvantage of relational data model is that it's different from object data model and requires a translational layer that increases code complexity.

## 8. Conclusion

To sum up, the relational data model is a rather complex and general concept that underlies most modern DBMS. The information that you got from this topic reveals the magic power hidden from you under the hood of an information system or a DBMS. Hopefully, it will help you correctly design the database structure and make informed decisions on its modification.
