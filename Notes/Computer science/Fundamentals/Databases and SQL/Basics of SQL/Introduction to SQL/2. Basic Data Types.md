# Basic Data Types

 As you already know, SQL is a language used for working with different types of data organized into a table. Usually, data values from the same column in a table have the same meaning and type. For example, a table `Car` may look like this:
 
| manufacture_year |	color | 	horsepower |	price 	|electricity 	|...|
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|2018 |	red 	|283 |	34.990 |	TRUE |	...|
|2019 	|black |	313 |	50.000 |	FALSE |	...|
|... |	... 	|... |	... |	... |	...|

We see that values in the `manufacture year` column are integer numbers, values in `price` are decimal, and values in `electricity` are boolean. SQL databases usually require that each column in a database table has a name and a **data type**. The columndata type restricts the set of values that can be stored in the column and defines a set of possible operations on them.

ANSI standard defines a pretty complex set of data types. Besides, database vendors usually add their non-standard data options. In this topic, we will consider a very basic subset of data types: `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`, `VARCHAR`, and `BOOLEAN`.


## 1. Numerical data types

`INTEGER` is a numeric data type that represents some range of mathematical integers (usually from -2147483648 to +2147483647).`INTEGER` type is good for counters, numeric identifiers, and any integer business value you can imagine that fits the scale range.

In everyday life, we usually face decimal numbers quite a lot: for example, when measuring body temperature (36.6 degrees Celsius) or counting our precious finances ($103050.79). SQL supports a special data type for such values – `DECIMAL(precision, scale)`.

This type has two parameters: precision and scale.

- **Scale** is the count of digits to the right of the decimal point.

- **Precision** is the total count of digits in the number.

The `FLOAT` data type is an approximate numeric data type used for floating-point numbers. With the `FLOAT` data type, we can store very large or very small numbers. Also, it is used for calculations that require fast processing. The `FLOAT` data type has an optional parameter n that specifies the precision and storage size (from 1 to 53).

By the way, sometimes in SQL, you can encounter the `REAL` data type. And so `REAL` is `FLOAT(24)`, or `FLOAT` of certain accuracy.

## 2. Text

Of course, one may want to process something other than numeric data, and SQL supports a family of data types designed to represent text data. Let's consider one of them, quite universal and basic – `VARCHAR(n)`.

This type represents a string of symbols of varying lengths not longer than `n`. For example, one can insert the strings `apple`, `plum`, and `peach` into a column with the type `VARCHAR(5)`. The strings `orange` and `banana` will exceed the length restriction and the system will either truncate them or generate an error if one tries to insert such long values.

## 3. Boolean

The `BOOLEAN` type represents boolean logic values: either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This simple data type can be utilized for any attributes with flag semantics, for example, whether a client has visited a competitor's site.

## 4. Who defines types and how?

As a database user, you should just know the types of table columns you utilize to be able to process them correctly. However, as a software engineer, you should also know how to create a table and define the column types.

Let's consider an example of an SQL query that defines a table `census` with five columns: `id` of type `INTEGER`, `name` of type `VARCHAR(20)`, `birth_place_latitude` of type `REAL`, `year_income` of type `DECIMAL(20,3)`, and `is_parent` of type `BOOLEAN`.
```sql
CREATE TABLE census (
    id INTEGER,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    birth_place_latitude REAL,
    year_income DECIMAL(20,3),
    is_parent BOOLEAN
);
```
One may see the following pattern:
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name_1 column_type_1,
    ..., 
    column_name_n column_type_n
);
```

## 5. Conclusion

Data may be very diverse, and SQL supports an extensive set of data types to represent this diversity. We have discussed a basic subset of data types just to start with, yet there is more to the topic: type casting, compound types, special types for numeric data, text, timestamps, and so on.
