# EduTools
* With Educational Products, we can learn and teach programming languages in the form of coding tasks and custom verification tests right inside of JetBrains IntelliJ Platform based IDEs.
* When we open a course, we will see the main tool windows used to get around: Project View, Task Description, Editor.

## 1. Project View
* Project View shows the course syllabus: list of lessons with lesson steps, or tasks. To navigate to a task, click on its name.
* We can hide the Project View window by clicking on the Project tool button or with the ⌘1/Alt + 1 shortcut. This will give us more space for code and the task description. Click the Project tool button (or invoke ⌘1/Alt + 1) once again to show the hidden Project View.

## 2. Task Description
The Task Description window gives us all the information we need to complete a task:
* Learning and reading materials for theory tasks
* Question and variants of the answers to the quizzes
* Problem descriptions for programming assignments
* Use Task Description icons for the following actions:
	* ![]((11)%20EduTools/b39814fa-4aea-40c7-9ff0-14e2ecd9eacf.png) –  to check if a task assignment is done right for the quizzes and programming tasks (⌥⌘⏎/Ctrl + Alt + ⏎)
	* ![]((11)%20EduTools/e3e28d87-181e-403a-a722-8a49d66ab75f.png)  - to go to the previous/next task (⌘,/⌘. or in Win keymap - Ctrl + ,/Ctrl + . )
	* ![]((11)%20EduTools/6774c496-1cfc-4854-ad62-9f065446e8ed.png)– to drop all the task changes and start it anew (⇧⌘X/Ctrl + ⇧ + X)
	* ![]((11)%20EduTools/7fc77294-b534-4e7e-a584-0e9e2c5456eb.png) – the Run button on the left side of the editor runs the code. Combinations Ctrl + Alt+ R/Option+ Shift + F10 allow us to use the Run menu, where we can choose what we need to run.
	* ![]((11)%20EduTools/b4d892dc-ad43-411c-89d9-901f0407ce68.png) – to view the task page on Hyperskill and leave a comment.
	Task Description needs to be visible, to hide it completely is not 
	advised. But still, we can make it a bit less distracting by moving it out 		of the way.
	If working with two monitors, one of the best options is to switch the 		Task Description panel to the floating mode and move it to the second 	monitor or just place it near the main IDE window.
	* ![]((11)%20EduTools/d0cd46fc-09d5-451b-aefe-bf9c355c48e7.png)  We can do so with the help of special tool window settings icon.

## 3. Editor
* The Editor is our playground and where we will mainly be programming. We  can experiment here for the theory tasks and quizzes without being checked.
* For programming assignments in the Editor, we will find the code we need to fix, or we will write our own code from scratch. This code will be checked.
* ![]((11)%20EduTools/821767a3-9046-47e2-a541-8da61076fe4f.png) With this icon on the left gutter, we can always run our code.
* If we want to easily go back to the Editor and focus on the code, the Hide All Windows command (⇧⌘F12/Ctrl + ⇧ + F12) is the best option. Just invoke it once again to get all the windows back.
