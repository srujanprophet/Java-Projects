# IDEA Basics
* The main goal of IntelliJ IDEA is to raise productivity while writing the code.

## 1. Use keyboard shortcuts
* Keyboard shortcuts can significantly speed up coding and even reduce **the risks of Repetitive Strain Injury**. IntelliJ IDEA is a keyboard-centric IDE. We can choose one of the pre-configured shortcut schemes, or a keymap, in Preferences | Keymap.

## 2. Go to the dark side
* IntelliJ IDEA initially uses the default light color scheme, but we can always switch to the dark Darcula scheme. Going to to Preferences | Appearance & Behaviour | Appearance and choosing Darcula as Theme under UI Options section.
* We can use` âŒ˜`/`Ctrl+ ` shortcut to switch quickly between color schemes and keymaps.

## 3. Local Terminal
* IntelliJ IDEA features a local terminal that makes it possible to access the command line. Depending on the platform, we can work with command prompt, powershell, bash, etc. Using the terminal, we can execute any command without leaving the IDE.
* To run the console, press Alt + F12 or click the Terminal tool window button.
