# IDE
## 1. What is an IDE?
* Writing just one program involves a whole variety of tasks: we write the code, find and fix errors that inevitably arise, then the code has to be compiled, run, and documented.
* All of this has to be done over and over again. With small programs like **Hello World**, we can perform these tasks using a simple text editor to write the source code and a set of tools to translate and start the programs.
* Some text editors can even highlight the syntax, which simplifies the writing process, but this may not suffice for working on something larger and more complex.
* As a professional developer, we need a specialized tool to navigate through multiple-file programs, modify, compile, run, and debug them, display syntax errors, and so on.
* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE) ** is precisely such a tool: it offers a single program in which developers can deal with all these common tasks. Using an IDE provides tight-knit components with a similar user interface, automates some routine tasks, and even gives advice and feedback.
* There are a lot of IDEs for different programming languages. Some support only a single language, while others support multiple or can be extended with plugins.

## 2. IDEs for Java Developers
There are several widely used modern environments for Java Developers (but they can be used for other languages as well) :
* * IntelliJ IDEA [  [installation guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/install-and-set-up-product.html)  |  [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA)  ] is a great environment supporting most Java technologies and frameworks. It provides code autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring. It can also be extended with plugins and comes in three versions: free Community Edition and Educational Edition, and commercial Professional Edition.
* Eclipse [  [installation guide](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)  |  [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software))  ] is the most widely used Java IDE notable for its extensive plugin system.
* NetBeans [  [download](https://netbeans.org/downloads/)  |  [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBeans)  ] is yet another IDE with a cool name. Its defining feature is modularity; that is, all its functions  are provided by modules – small software components.

## 3. IDEs for Python developers
* IDLE [  [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE)  |  [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html)  ] is not for the idlers, but it’s the right choice for beginners. It is a simple basic IDE that comes bundled with the default implementation of Python.
* PyCharm [  [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)  |  [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyCharm) ] is the most widely used Python IDE that comes in three versions: free Community Edition and Educational Edition, and commercial Professional Edition with extra features. It provides syntax and error highlighting, autocompletion, debugging, and code refactoring.
*  Visual Studio Code [  [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) |  [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code) |  [FAQ and docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)] is a multi-programming language IDE. It was ranked the most popular developer environment tool in the Stack Overflow 2019 Developer Survey. It provides syntax and error highlighting, autocompletion, debugging, and code refactoring.

PyCharm and Visual Studio Code are integrated with version control systems. Also, both of them support Python web development (and in case of PyCharm, even data science!), while IDLE does not.

## 4. IDEs for Kotlin developers
* IntelliJ IDEA [ [installation guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/install-and-set-up-product.html)  |  [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA) |  [starting guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started.html) ] was the first environment to provide Kotlin support out of the box. It includes Kotlin file, code templates, a configurable compiler, and a debugger. Also, since Kotlin is often mixed with Java, IntelliJ IDEA provides an easy method to add Kotlin code to an existing Java project (you can read more about it  [here](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2013/10/how-to-configure-kotlin-in-your-project/) ).
* Eclipse [ [installation guide](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)  |  [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)) |  [starting guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started-eclipse.html) ] provides Kotlin support via a plugin. Although it’s not quite as powerful as IntelliJ IDEA, it allows building and running Kotlin applications, as well as quickly adding Kotlin pieces to Java projects.
* Android Studio [  [download](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) |   [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Studio)  |  [starting guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html) ] is an IDE designed specifically for mobile Android development, which Kotlin is often used for (the more you know: it is, in fact, Google’s preferred language for it). If you need Kotlin to build mobile apps, Android Studio is probably the best option. It includes Android emulator to run and debug apps, Android-specific code refactoring, and a graphical user interface designer.

Basically, for general purposes, it’s better to use IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, and Android Studio for Kotlin Android development.

## 5. IDEs and Android
* An officially supported environment for native Android app development is Android Studio [  [download](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)  |  [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Studio)  |  [user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro)  ]. It is notable for its unique features, such as Android-specific code refactoring and an emulator to run and debug apps. Although Kotlin is Google’s preference for Android development, Android Studio also supports other programming languages: Java and C++.
* Before the release of Android Studio, the officially supported and most widely used IDE for Android development was Eclipse with its Android Development Tools plugin. This plugin is now, according to Google,[officially deprecated](https://developer.android.com/studio/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt) . Besides, IntelliJ IDEA also supports Android development [  [read more](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started-with-android-development.html) ], and so does NetBeans via a plugin; again, options are multiple.
