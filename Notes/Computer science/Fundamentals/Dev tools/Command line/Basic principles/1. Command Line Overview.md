# Command line overview
* There are two ways of interaction with the OS: one is more verbal, another is for visual ones, but both definitely deserve some appreciation. These two methods are the Command-line interface and the Graphical user interface.

## 1. What is the command-line?
* **Command-line interface** or **CLI** is computer software where we can interact with the OS via text commands. On the other hand, the **Graphical User Interface** or **GUI** provides an interface with many icons and menus. Here, we give commands to the OS by clicking on these icons or menu items.
* Generally, command-line interface is much more flexible and has more options. For example, we can combine commands to create a new one, while we cannot do that via a graphical interface. Some software can even have a command-line interface only, thus requiring its user to know command-line basics.
* Besides, programs executable by the command-line interface can be written in a command language. They are called **shell scripts** on UNIX-systems, Linux and Mac OS, and **batch files** on Windows.
* All operating systems have command-line interfaces. Applications may have it as well. Also, modern programming languages provide an interactive command-line mode, in which code can be executed line by line.

## 2. Accessing command-line interpreter
* We can open it by simply searching as *cmd* in Windows and *terminal* in Linux distributions.
* For location of the terminal, we can try the following paths :
	* For Windows 10 or 8 at *Start*->*Windows System*->*Command Prompt*.
	* For Windows 7, Vista or XP at *Start* -> *All Programs* -> *Accessories* -> *Command Prompt*.
	* For Mac OS at *Applications* -> *Utilities* -> *Terminal*. Some Mac users prefer iTerm2, a replacement for Terminal, because its slightly more user-friendly.
	* For Linux: it depends on the system, but usually, CLI is located at *Applications* -> *Accessories* -> *Terminal* or at *Applications* -> *System* -> *Terminal*. 
* When we open it, we’ll see a black (or white) window. If everything is okay, we’ll see **command prompt** at where we’ll be typing our command - an indicator that our computer is ready to accept commands.
* For Windows, command prompt ends with `>`, for Linux and Mac OS, use `$`. To execute a command, type it and then press Enter.

## 3. Learning Commands
* When we open the CLI, we will see something similar to the below text.
`C:\Users\name>`
It means that we are in this directory and we can work in the CLI.
* First, type `whoami` and press *Enter*. Unfortunately, it won’t provide us with a deep satisfying answer about who we really are, but we will see something like this:
`desktop-qd7c3ju\sruji`
* Next, type `dir` if using Windows or `ls` if using Linux/macOS and press *Enter*. Both of these commands return the list of files and folders in our current directory. 
* For escaping, type `exit` and we’ll be out…of the CLI because this command lets us exit it.

## 4. Conclusion
The important thing to know is that excellent GUIs haven’t made CLI obsolete. It is still one of the quickest ways to get our job done.
For a developer, it is very important to have good knowledge of what commands are available to us.
