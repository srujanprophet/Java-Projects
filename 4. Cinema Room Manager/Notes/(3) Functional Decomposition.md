# Functional Decomposition
* The approach of dividing a complex program into subroutines is called **functional decomposition**.

## 1. Solving Complex Tasks
* _Functional_ decomposition is based on the principle of breaking a problem into small pieces called methods.
* To make code less specific and more flexible, we use _flexible_ decomposition.

## 2. Decomposing a program into methods
* **Functional decomposition** is simply a process of decomposing a problem into several functions or methods. Each method does a particular task so that we can perform these methods in a row to get the results needed.
* These methods are easier to read, understand, reuse, test and debug.

## 3. Adding new features
* If we want to add a new feature, all we have to do is define the method with this feature.
* We can easily test separate components since they are determined in separate methods. This also makes it easier to support the program in the future.

## 4. Conclusion
* Functional decomposition has several advantages. It helps us to:
	* structure the code
	* follow the general logic of the program
	* make changes easily
	* test separate methods
* Using functional decomposition will help in creating neat and understandable programs that are easy to work with.
