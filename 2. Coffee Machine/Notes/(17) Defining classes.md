# Defining classes
* When programmers are writing a real program, they use standard classes as building blocks. However, they often need to declare new program-specific classes to better represent the domain area. 

## 1. Declaring new classes
* A new class is declared with the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. For example, this is how we would create a class named Nothing:
```java
	class Nothing {
		// empty body
	} 
```
* A class body can include fields, methods, and constructors. **Fields** store data, **methods** define behavior and **constructors** allow us to create and initialize new objects of the class. 
* Fields and methods are considered to be class members. Not all Java classes have fields and methods so sometimes we will see classes without them.
* The source code of a class is placed in a `.java` file. Usually, a source code file contains only one class and has the same name as that class, but sometimes a file can contain more classes.

## 2. Writing fields
* A **field** is a variable that stores data. It may have any type, including primitive types (int, float, boolean and so on) and classes (even the same class). A class can have as many fields as we need.
E.g. declaring a class Patient:
```java
/**
 * The class is a "blueprint" patients
 */
class Patient {
    String name;
    int age;
    float height;
    String[] complaints;
}
```
This class represents a patient in a hospital information system. It has four fields for storing important information about the patient: `name`, `age`, `height`, and `complaints`. All objects of the class Patient have the same fields, but their values are different for each object.

## 3. Creating objects
* For creating an **instance** of the class `Patient` using the keyword **new** :
`Patient patient = new Patient();`
* When we create a new object, each field is initialized with the default value of the corresponding type.
```java
System.out.println(patient.name); // it prints null
System.out.println(patient.age); // it prints 0
```

## 4. Creating multiple objects of the same class
The following program creates two objects of the class `Patient` and prints the information about them. Both classes are placed in the same file named `PatientDemo.java`.
```java
public class PatientDemo {    
    public static void main(String args[]) {        
        Patient john = new Patient();        
        john.name = "John";
        john.age = 30;
        john.height = 180;        
        System.out.println(john.name + " " + john.age + " " + john.height);            
        Patient alice = new Patient(); 
        alice.name = "Alice";
        alice.age = 22;
        alice.height = 165;        
        System.out.println(alice.name + " " + alice.age + " " + alice.height);
    }
}
 
class Patient { 
    String name;
    int age;
    float height;
}
```
In the code above, weâ€™ve created two patients, John and Alice, defined the values of their fields and then printed out the information about them. So, the output of the code above is:
`John 30 180`
`Alice 22 165`

## 5. Summary
* Custom classes can be very useful because they allow us to define fields and methods that work best for our purposes.
* Fields keep the current state (data) of the instances of the class and their values can be different for different instances. 
* We can create objects of the class, assign values to their fields and use those objects in our programs. 
* All in all, classes are a very powerful tool.
