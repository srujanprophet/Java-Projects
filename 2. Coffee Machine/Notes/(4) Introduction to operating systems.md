# Introduction to operating systems
## 1. Operating system
* **The operating system (OS)** is a set of system software that manages communication between all other applications and hardware. It makes a device not just a set of iron, but a complex system with the effective performance for different tasks.
* Currently, there are a lot of operating systems that we can explore. The most used personal computer OS are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions. Most famous mobile operating systems are Android and iOS. Even smart kettles and smart fridges have an OS inside.


## 2. OS Functions
* The operating system controls the communication of all computer software and hardware. The OS can provide programs with restricted access for processor units, memory, hard drives, peripherals, and other resources.
* An OS is in control of giving a browser, a media player, or ten other applications, all the resources they need to run properly. At the same time, an OS is a fair referee and doesn’t allow an application to take more resources than it needs.
* Being a layer between application programs and hardware, the OS allows us to communicate with the device without knowing its specificity or mechanics.

* Any OS provides several essential services. Here is a list of some of them:
	* data protection and secure access;
	* resource management;
	* interaction between hardware and peripheral;
	* file management;
	* starting other programs.

## 3.  Operating system components
* A mandatory part of all operating systems is **the kernel**. It is the core and heart of an OS. Usually, it’s one of the first programs loaded when we turn on a computer.It provides all the needed function to run our programs.
* Typically, when we start an OS, we see **the Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. It is the type of interface that allows users to interact with the device using graphical icons and audio indicators. 
* Another way to interact with the OS is to use commands in a text-based terminal known as **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
* There are two types of kernels, known as monolithic kernel and microkernel. **The monolithic kernel** is a large program that performs most of the OS functions. 
* At the same time, **the microkernel** provides only a small subset of the OS functions, but we can extend it with additional modules known as **drivers**.
* There are other important parts of the OS between the kernel and the graphical user interface. Consider the following image :

## 4. Conclusion
The OS monitors the resources of the computer in a way to maximise efficiency. Without an OS, it would not have been possible to communicate with the computer.
