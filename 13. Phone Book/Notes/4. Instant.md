# Instant

The `java.time` package provides us with classes for working with chronographic units. In this topic, you will explore the `Instant` class: a **date-time unit** suitable for capturing event timestamps during the application execution. You will learn how to create those units and perform various operations with them. `Instant` has a lot in common with the `LocalDateTime` class but they also have differences which this theory will help you discover.


## 1. Creational methods

The `Instant` units are created in a similar way to `Period` and `Duration` class units. It provides static methods for creating the date and time in the **ISO 8601** format. `Instant` values are stored in a `long` variable storing the seconds counting from the **Java epoch** and an `int` variable storing the nanoseconds of a second. **Epoch** is a common date-time representation format counting the date and time relative to January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT) which looks like `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` in the ISO 8601 format. You can obtain this value with the `Instant.EPOCH` static field.
```java
Instant epoch = Instant.EPOCH;
System.out.println(epoch); // 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

In the code above the last `Z` stands for the time-zone ID, which is zero in our case. So, it shows us the epoch time of the GMT0 time zone. Of course, you can obtain the time of any zone you need. We will show how to do that later in this section.
So, in Java, when working with the Instant class, you specify the date before or after the epoch time counting in seconds and nanoseconds.
Let's start with the three basic methods you will probably use most:
```java
long posValue = 1234567890L;
long negValue = -1234567890L;

// Adding specified milliseconds to epoch
Instant milli = Instant.ofEpochMilli(posValue); // 1970-01-15T06:56:07.890Z
// Adding specified seconds to epoch
Instant second = Instant.ofEpochSecond(posValue); // 2009-02-13T23:31:30Z
// Adding specified milliseconds and nanoseconds to epoch
Instant secondNano = Instant.ofEpochSecond(posValue, 123L); // 2009-02-13T23:31:30.000000123Z
// Adding specified milliseconds and nanoseconds to epoch. Version 2
Instant nanoRounded = Instant.ofEpochSecond(posValue, 1_000_000_123L); // 2009-02-13T23:31:31.000000123Z


// Subtracting specified milliseconds from epoch
Instant milli = Instant.ofEpochMilli(negValue); // 1969-12-17T17:03:52.110Z
// Subtracting specified seconds from epoch
Instant second = Instant.ofEpochSecond(negValue); // 1930-11-18T00:28:30Z
// Subtracting specified milliseconds and nanoseconds from epoch
Instant secondNano = Instant.ofEpochSecond(negValue, 123L); // 1930-11-18T00:28:30.000000123Z
// Subtracting specified milliseconds and nanoseconds from epoch. Version 2
Instant nanoRounded = Instant.ofEpochSecond(negValue, 1_000_000_123L); // 1930-11-18T00:28:31.000000123Z
```

> Although `ofEpochSecond(long epochSecond, long nanoAdjustment)` accepts a `long` type variable, it rounds each **1bln** nanoseconds to a second and adds to the `epochSecond`, and the rest is stored in an `int` variable, as we mentioned earlier.

We created units bigger than January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT) by passing positive values to methods, and smaller units by passing negative values. As you see from the last letter, all of them show the time of GMT0 time zone. There will be many situations when you will need to obtain an `Instant` unit for a given time zone. In such cases you can use the `ZoneId` class to specify the zone:
```java
Instant instant = Instant.ofEpochSecond(1234567890L);
       
System.out.println(instant); // 2009-02-13T23:31:30Z 
System.out.println(instant.atZone(ZoneId.of("GMT+4"))); // 2009-02-14T03:31:30+04:00[GMT+04:00]
System.out.println(instant.atZone(ZoneId.of("+04:00"))); // 2009-02-14T03:31:30+04:00
System.out.println(instant.atZone(ZoneId.of("Asia/Yerevan"))); // 2009-02-14T03:31:30+04:00[Asia/Yerevan]
System.out.println(instant.atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault())); // 2009-02-14T03:31:30+04:00[Asia/Yerevan]
        
System.out.println(ZoneId.systemDefault().getId()); // Asia/Yerevan
System.out.println(ZoneId.systemDefault().getRules()); // ZoneRules[currentStandardOffset=+04:00]
```

If you don't know your time zone **ID** or the **offset** (the difference between a specified time zone and GMT0), the last two lines from the code above will help you. In our case, it shows Armenia/Yerevan time zone.
The next method for creating Instant units is `Instant.parse()`, which creates a unit object by accepting a text and parsing it to the `Instant` type.
```java
Instant instant = Instant.parse("2009-02-14T03:31:30Z");
    
System.out.println(instant); // 2009-02-14T03:31:30Z
System.out.println(instant.atZone(ZoneId.of("GMT+4"))); // 2009-02-14T07:31:30+04:00[GMT+04:00]
```

## 2. Operational methods

Now that you know how to create `Instant` units, let's explore its other methods which help us perform different kinds of operations. We will start with the simple `isBefore()`/`isAfter()` pair of methods comparing the chronological order of two units.
```java
Instant instant1 = Instant.ofEpochSecond(123456L);
Instant instant2 = Instant.ofEpochSecond(123456789L);
    
System.out.println(instant1.isAfter(instant2)); // false
System.out.println(instant1.isBefore(instant2)); // true
```

Besides these two returning the `boolean` result of the comparison, the class implements the `compareTo()` method from the `Comparable` interface:
```java
Instant instant1 = Instant.ofEpochSecond(123456L);
Instant instant2 = Instant.ofEpochSecond(123456789L);

System.out.println(instant1.compareTo(instant2)); // -1
```

Depending on the situation, you can choose which approach to comparison is more suitable for you.
Working with date and time units, you will definitely need to add or subtract two units at some point. This class doesn't implement the `addTo()` and `subtractFrom()` methods that are implemented in the `Period` and `Duration` classes, but it implements some others: `minus()`, `plus()` and their "subversions", such as `minusSeconds()`, `plusSeconds()`, and so on.
```java
Instant instant = Instant.ofEpochSecond(123456L);

System.out.println(instant); // 1970-01-02T10:17:36Z

System.out.println(instant.minus(Period.ofDays(1))); // 1970-01-01T10:17:36Z
System.out.println(instant.minus(Duration.ofDays(1))); //  1970-01-01T10:17:36Z
System.out.println(instant.minus(1, ChronoUnit.DAYS)); // 1970-01-01T10:17:36Z

System.out.println(instant.plus(Period.ofDays(1))); // 1970-01-03T10:17:36Z
System.out.println(instant.plus(Duration.ofDays(1))); // 1970-01-03T10:17:36Z
System.out.println(instant.plus(1, ChronoUnit.DAYS)); // 1970-01-03T10:17:36Z

System.out.println(instant); // 1970-01-02T10:17:36Z
```

These two methods have limitations concerning supported unit types. They accept units that are smaller than days (inclusive).
```java
Instant instant = Instant.ofEpochSecond(123456L);
 
System.out.println(instant.minus(Period.of(123, 12, 3))); // UnsupportedTemporalTypeException
System.out.println(instant.plus(1, ChronoUnit.WEEKS)); // UnsupportedTemporalTypeException
        
System.out.println(instant.plus(Period.ofWeeks(1))); // 1970-01-09T10:17:36Z
```

Here, all lines except the last one will throw an exception. We won't tell you why: do some research, investigate the code, and feel free to share the answer with other learners.
This class has one more interesting method to calculate the difference between two units. It shows the time until another `Instant` unit is represented in the form of the specified unit:
```java
Instant instant = Instant.ofEpochSecond(100200300L);
System.out.println(Instant.EPOCH.until(instant, ChronoUnit.DAYS)); // 1159
System.out.println(Instant.EPOCH.until(instant, ChronoUnit.HOURS)); // 27833
```

## 3. Get operations

Now let's take a look at a group of similar methods performing `get` operations from an `Instant` unit. There are three different methods for this purpose, which will show different results depending on how you created the `Instant` unit. We will consider one case using `Instant.ofEpochSecond()`, and you can explore the rest of them yourself.
```java
Instant ofEpochSecond = Instant.ofEpochSecond(123456L, 789L);
System.out.println(ofEpochSecond); // 1970-01-02T10:17:36.000000789Z
System.out.println(ofEpochSecond.getEpochSecond()); // 123456

System.out.println(ofEpochSecond.get(ChronoField.MICRO_OF_SECOND)); // 0
System.out.println(ofEpochSecond.get(ChronoField.MILLI_OF_SECOND)); // 0
System.out.println(ofEpochSecond.get(ChronoField.NANO_OF_SECOND)); // 789

System.out.println(ofEpochSecond.getLong(ChronoField.INSTANT_SECONDS)); // 123456
System.out.println(ofEpochSecond.getLong(ChronoField.MICRO_OF_SECOND)); // 0
System.out.println(ofEpochSecond.getLong(ChronoField.MILLI_OF_SECOND)); // 0
System.out.println(ofEpochSecond.getLong(ChronoField.NANO_OF_SECOND)); // 789
```

The first `getEpochSecond()` returns a `long` value storing the unit seconds. The other two perform similarly, but the `get()` method returns the value of the specified unit as an `int`, while `getLong()` returns a `long`. Since `ofEpochSecond()` doesn't use milliseconds, `get(ChronoField.MICRO_OF_SECOND)` and `get(ChronoField.MILLI_OF_SECOND)` return zero. The same method calls with the same arguments wouldn't return zero if the `Instant` unit was created using the `ofEpochMilli()` method.

> Note that both `get()` and `getLong()` methods accept only those `ChronoField` units you can see in the code above. Passing other types will cause an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.

## 4. Instant vs LocalDateTime

Although `Instant` and `LocalDateTime` are date-time units, they are completely different in their nature. `Instant` is a representation of a moment on a timeline relative to an epoch. `LocalDateTime` is a representation of a calendar date and daytime combination. The first one stores its value in seconds and nanoseconds, while the second one stores it as a pair of `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` objects. Finally, `LocalDateTime` doesn't contain any information regarding a time zone, but if you create its object with the `now()` method, it will be created depending on your system's default zone. On the other hand, `Instant` contains that information and shows the GMT0 time-stamp by default in any case.

```java
Instant instant = Instant.now(); // System time zone independent, shows GMT0
LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now(); // System time zone dependent
```

## 5. Conclusion

In this topic dedicated to the `Instant` class, you learned how to create its units and how those unit values are stored internally. You also learned about some of its operational methods and its main differences from the `LocalDateTime` class. The functionality of this class is rather straightforward but you should study it in detail as it has plenty of features and it's crucial to understand the behavior of each of them.
