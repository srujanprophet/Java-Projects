# Characters
* The `char` type is used to represent letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and other symbols. Each character is just a symbol enclosed in single quotes.
```java
char lowerCaseLetter = 'a';
char upperCaseLetter = 'Q';
char number = '1';
char space = ' ';
char dollar = '$';
```

* This type can represent all characters in all languages as well as some special and computer symbols. It corresponds to the **Unicode** format.
* Unicode is a computer encoding methodology that assigns a unique number for every character. It doesn’t matter what language, or computer platform it’s on. This is important in a global, networked world, and for computer systems that must accommodate multiple languages and special characters. Unicode truly unifies all of these into a single standard.

## Initializing characters with codes
* A character can be also created using its hexadecimal code in  [the Unicode table](https://unicode-table.com/en/) . The code starts with `\u`.
```java
char ch = '\u0040'; // it represents '@'
System.out.println(ch); // @ 
```
* Although we use a sequence of characters to represent such code, the code represents exactly one character.
* As an example, Latin capital letters have hexadecimal codes from `’\u0041’` to `’\u005A’`, and Latin small letters have codes from ‘`\u0061’` to `’\u007A’`.
* The `char` type has a minimum value encoded as  `‘\u0000’` and the maximum value encoded as ‘`\uffff’`.
* It is also possible to initialize a char with a positive integer number.
```java
char ch = 64;
System.out.println(ch); // @ 
```
* Any `char` variable may be considered as an unsigned integer value in the range from `0` to `65535`.

## Retrieving subsequent characters
* There are two operators for adding (`+`) and subtracting (`-`) integer numbers in order to get the next and previous character according to the Unicode order.
```java
char ch = 'b';
ch += 1; // 'c'
ch -= 2; // 'a' 
```
* It is also possible adding and subtracting one character to / from another one.
```java
char ch = 'b';
ch += 'a';
ch -= 'b';
System.out.println(ch); // prints 'a' without quotes 
```

* Actually, these operations manipulate with codes of characters, `’b’` has the next code after `’a’`.
* It is possible to use increment (`++`) and decrement (`—`) operators in prefix and postfix forms.
```java
char ch = 'A';
ch += 10;
System.out.println(ch);   // 'K'
System.out.println(++ch); // 'L'
System.out.println(++ch); // 'M'
System.out.println(--ch); // 'L'
```

## Escape sequences
* There are some special characters starting with backslash `\` which are known as the escape or control sequences. 
* They do not have corresponding symbols and cannot be found on a keyboard.
* To represent such characters we use a pair of regular symbols. In a program, this pair will be considered as exactly one character with the appropriate code.
	* `‘\n’` is the newline character;
	* `‘\t’` is the tab character;
	* `‘\r’` is the carriage return character;
	* `‘\\’` is the backslash character itself;
	* `‘\’’` is the single quote mark;
	* `‘\”’` is the double quote mark.

* Here are several examples:
```java
System.out.print('\t'); // makes a tab
System.out.print('a');  // prints 'a'
System.out.print('\n'); // goes to the new line
System.out.print('c');  // prints 'c'
```
This code prints:
```
  a
c
```
* There is also a character to represent a single space `’ ‘`. It is just a regular character, not an escape sequence.
