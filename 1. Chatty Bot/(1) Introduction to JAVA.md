# Introduction to JAVA
## What is JAVA?
* **Java** is a general-purpose, modern programming language initially developed by  [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) , and currently owned by  [Oracle Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation) .
*  The key feature of the language is **platform independence**: it means that the same Java program can be run on multiple platforms without any changes! This principle is also known as “write once, run anywhere” (or WORA).
* Java is used in our **Android** smartphones, the financial services industry, telecommunications, embedded systems and in many other areas. 
* Medical applications use it to store patient data, computer games such as Minecraft are created using Java; development tools like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse wouldn’t exist without it.

## A short history of JAVA
* The Java language project was initiated in 1991 by James Gosling and his colleagues. 
* In the beginning, the language was called “Oak.” Later the project was renamed “Java” a reference to Java coffee. For this reason, the language’s logo is a cup of coffee.
* Sun Microsystems released Java 1.0 in 1996. After that, new versions were released every 1 to 3 years. Since Java 9, released in 2017, new versions have been released every 6 months.

## Some Important Features of JAVA
* The most important feature of Java is  **platform independence**.
* Another important feature is a **simple** and **clear syntax**. Many elements of the language are easy to read and are widely used in other programming languages such as C/C++, C#, JavaScript, and Go.
* Manual memory cleaning can lead to bugs in the code. Fortunately, Java has a **garbage collector** that **automatically cleans memory** from unused objects during runtime.
* Java supports multiple programming paradigms. Java is primarily an imperative language based on the object-oriented concept: almost every part of a program is an object. 
* Therefore, a program itself can be considered a set of interacting objects. 
* Also, it partially supports modern programming paradigms such as *generic programming*, *concurrent programming*, *functional programming*, and some others.

##### In conclusion, Java is a modern and popular programming language that can be successfully used in almost all domains.
